# TRY dApp: a dApp for the [NFT Lottery](https://github.com/fedehsq/nft_lottery/)

The Dapp provides different interfaces, one for the lottery manager, and
one for the lottery users.

## Features

There is a function Create Lottery which is used by the manager to create a new lottery. \
This function creates an event which is notified to all the potential users who can be interested in
joining the lottery. \
Later, another event notifies the users of the start of a new round of the lottery. \
The dApp is able not only to invoke smart contracts' functions, but also to catch events
generated by the smart contracts. \
